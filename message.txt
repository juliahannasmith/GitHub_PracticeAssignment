The thing about the river is you never step in the same river twice.

I can show you the wooooorld, shining shimmering splendid.
Tell me princess now when did you last let your heart decide.
dooo doo doo do to do 
I can open your eyeeeeees, take you wonder by wonder. Over side ways and under on a magic carpet riiiiiide!!!!!


i mean like ive been searching my whole life to find my own place 
maybe its the party talking or the chocolate fondue

BUT WITH YOU
i see your face
and it nothing like ive ever known before
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR
